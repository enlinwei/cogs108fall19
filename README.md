- I forgot mention this in section, but if you have the Windows git bash, you can right click when you're in a folder and choose "git bash here" and it will open up a git bash in the directory of that folder so you don't have to keep changing diretories to go to folders you want. It's very covenient and I think it would be great for you guys to know.
